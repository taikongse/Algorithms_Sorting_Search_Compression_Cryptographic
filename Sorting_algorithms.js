/*Sorting algorithms: These algorithms are used to sort a list of items into a particular order. Some examples include bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

This implementation of bubble sort works by comparing adjacent elements in the array and swapping them if they are out of order. It repeats this process until the array is sorted. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it less efficient for large inputs.

This implementation of insertion sort works by iterating over the elements of the array and inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted subarray. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it less efficient for large inputs.

This implementation of merge sort works by dividing the array into smaller subarrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together. It has a time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it more efficient for large inputs than bubble sort or insertion sort.*/
