/*
Search algorithms: These algorithms are used to search for a particular item in a list. Some examples include linear search and binary search.

This implementation of linear search works by iterating over the elements of the array and returning the index of the first element that matches the search key. If the search key is not found, it returns -1. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), which makes it less efficient for large inputs.

This implementation of binary search works by dividing the array in half and searching only in the half that is likely to contain the search key. It repeats this process until the search key is found or it is determined that the search key is not present in the array. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it more efficient for large inputs than linear search. However, it requires that the array be sorted beforehand.
